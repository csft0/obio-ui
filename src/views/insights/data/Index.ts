<span style="font-family:Tahoma, sans-serif;">With the vigorous development of biomedicine, lentiviral vectors, due to their characteristics of safety, stable integration and expression, and the ability to carry large gene segments, have been widely used as a core tool for gene delivery in both basic research and clinical treatment. Scientists continue to conduct in-depth research on lentiviral vectors, and their many iterations have laid the foundation for industry development. CAR-NK therapy is expected to become another blockbuster product after CAR-T therapy. The gene delivery of NK cells is an extremely important part of the CAR-NK production process and is currently a significant industry challenge. Solving the problem of efficiently transducing NK cells with lentiviruses can provide strong support for the development of CAR-NK therapy.</span>
